            <p>On this day, I was supposed to have my second counseling session with the department at my school.
                i feel like Dr. Jester really just wants me to do what makes me happy. As of right now, finishing this program
                and my degree will get me to make enough money where I can finally pay for myself to study my real passion: psychology! </p>
